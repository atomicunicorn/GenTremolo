# GenTremolo
VST / AU plugin with generative/rhythmic randomization of the tremolo

GenTremolo is a tremolo audio effect which has three modes.

(1) Standard: Rythmically-synced tremolo with controllable waveforms (square, sloped square, sine, triangle)

(2) Random: Rythmically-synced tremolo that randomly switches the frequency of the tremolo between different beat division and controllable waveforms.

(3) Euclidean: Rythmically-synced tremolo that generatively oscillates incoming audio between on and off by following a euclidean rythm generator.
